# terms_of_use

The legal department now requires all of your software to output a disclaimer before the running of your program. To save your fellow developers on the team some trouble, you decide to write a method that does this for you and others.

Your disclaimer method should output the following text:

***DISCLAIMER***
This code may not work the way you expect it to.
By using this temperamental program, you agree not to
sue the pants off of its creator.
***
Here is the code to your existing program. You're still working out the bugs.

puts "3 + 2 = #{rand(6)}"
Uh oh! The lawyers are back and they're getting increasingly anxious. They have requested that you require the user to accept the disclaimer before running the program. If the user does not accept the disclaimer, the attorneys want to ensure their safety by reaffirming the disclaimer and requiring that the user accept.

To be extra safe, they also want you to output the disclaimer after the program has completed.
